# ðŸŽ® Tic Tac Toe Game

A simple, interactive Tic Tac Toe game built using React VITE , JavaScript and CSS. Play with a friend on the same device and enjoy the classic 3x3 grid game!

## ðŸ§© How It Works

- Two players take turns placing X and O on a 3x3 grid.
- The first player to align three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins.
- If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
- A "Restart" button lets you reset the game anytime.
